# NLP Key Concepts

NLP (Natural Language Processing) involves the use of computational techniques to understand and process human language. This README provides a brief overview of key NLP concepts along with examples.

## 1. Tokenization
Tokenization refers to the process of splitting text into smaller units called tokens.

**Example:**
Input: "I love NLP!"
Output: ["I", "love", "NLP", "!"]

## 2. Text Normalization
Text normalization involves transforming text into a standard format by removing noise, punctuation, and converting to lowercase.

**Example:**
Input: "The weather's great today, isn't it?"
Output: "the weathers great today is not it"

## 3. Stopwords
Stopwords are commonly used words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that do not carry significant meaning and are often removed from text.

**Example:**
Input: "The cat is sitting on the mat."
Output: "cat sitting mat."

## 4. Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form.

**Example:**
Input: "Caring"
Stemmed: "car"
Lemmatized: "care"

## 5. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
POS tagging involves assigning grammatical tags to words in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

**Example:**
Input: "The cat is sitting on the mat."
POS tags: [Determiner, Noun, Verb, Verb, Preposition, Determiner, Noun, Punctuation]

## 6. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
NER identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., names, locations, organizations) in text.

**Example:**
Input: "Apple Inc. is planning to open a new store in London next month."
Entities: [ORGANIZATION: "Apple Inc.", LOCATION: "London"]

## 7. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

**Example:**
Input: "The movie was excellent!"
Sentiment: Positive

## 8. Language Modeling
Language modeling focuses on predicting the next word or sequence of words in a sentence using statistical techniques or neural networks.

**Example:**
Given the phrase "I want to eat __" and a language model trained on a recipe dataset, it can predict the next word with high probability, such as "pizza," "cake," or "pasta."

## 9. Word Embeddings
Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.

**Example:**
The word "king" might be represented as [0.2, 0.4, -0.1, ...] using Word2Vec embeddings.

## 10. Neural Networks in NLP
Neural networks are used in NLP for various tasks such as text classification, machine translation, and text generation.

**Example:**
Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) for text generation, given the prompt "Once upon a __", the model can generate a sequence like "time," "day," or "night."

These key concepts provide a foundation for understanding and working with NLP techniques and applications. By leveraging these concepts, you can process, analyze, and derive insights from human language data.
